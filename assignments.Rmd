### Assignment expectations and grading

The rubric for each assignment will be provided when it is assigned so you know what to prioritize. You make work with up to 2 classmates, but must list your collaboratorsâ€™ names on your assignment. You are encouraged to collaborate on code, but must respond to conceptual questions individually. All assignment dates will be posted in advance. Late assignments will receive 10% deduction per day, up to a maximum of 3 days. You may request a 48-hour extension if extenuating circumstances arise.
