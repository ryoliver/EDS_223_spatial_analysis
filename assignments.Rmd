### Assignment expectations and grading

The rubric for each assignment will be provided when it is assigned so you know what to prioritize. You make work with up to 3 classmates, but must list your collaboratorsâ€™ names on your assignment. All assignment dates will be posted in advance. No late assignments will be accepted. If extenuating circumstances arise and are communicated, late assignments will receive 10% deduction per day, up to a maximum of 3 days.
