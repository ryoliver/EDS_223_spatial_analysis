You make work with up to 2 classmates, but must list your collaborators’ names on your assignment. You are encouraged to collaborate on code, but must respond to conceptual questions individually. All assignment dates will be posted in advance. Late assignments will receive 10% deduction per day, up to a maximum of 3 days. You may request a 48-hour extension if extenuating circumstances arise.\r\nGrading rubric\r\nEach assignment will provide specific details of the point breakdowns per question. However, we will follow the general rubric below for all assignments.\r\nCode must run\r\nA 50% deduction will be taken if code does not run\r\nFull credit will be given to sub-questions that were completed correctly\r\nFollow the spirit (not the letter) of the question\r\nFor questions that ask for aesthetic updates (i.e. changing legend titles), simply providing ANY modification is not sufficient\r\nA 50% deduction will be taken for answers that do not improve legibility\r\nAnswer for yourself\r\nAlthough you are encouraged to collaborate with up to 2 classmates, you must provide your own answer to any non-code based questions\r\nAll members of your group will lose full credit for non-code based questions that are copy/pasted among group members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The emphasis is on deep understanding of spatial data models and the analytic operations they enable. Recognizing remotely sensed data as a key data type within environmental data science, this course will also introduce fundamental concepts and applications of remote sensing. In addition to this theoretical background, students will become familiar with libraries, packages, and APIs that support spatial analysis in R.\r\nWelcome!\r\nTeaching team\r\nInstructor: Ruth Oliver (rutholiver@bren.ucsb.edu)\r\nOffice: Bren Hall 4512\r\nStudent hours: Friday 1-2pm PT\r\nThe best way to contact me is: email\r\nTeaching assistant: Allie Caughman (acaughman@bren.ucsb.edu)\r\nStudent hours: Tuesday 12:30-1:30pm PT (location TBD)\r\nThe best way to contact me is: email\r\nImportant links\r\nCourse syllabus\r\nCode of Conduct\r\nAlert us to any absences here\r\nGeocomputation with R\r\nWeekly course schedule\r\nTuesday 9:30-12:15 PT (Bren Hall 1424)\r\nDiscussion section - Thursday 11:30-12:20 or 12:30-1:20 PT (Bren 3526)\r\nCourse requirements\r\nMinimum MEDS device requirements\r\nR version 4.2.0 (or higher)\r\nRStudio version 2022.07.01 (or higher)\r\nGitHub account\r\nTentative topics\r\nWeek\r\nTopics\r\n1 (10/2)\r\nCourse overview & intro to spatial data models\r\n2 (10/9)\r\nIntro to vector data\r\n3 (10/16)\r\nVector operations\r\n4 (10/23)\r\nIntro to raster data & operations\r\n5 (10/30)\r\nGuest speakers\r\n6 (11/6)\r\nIntro to RS & EM radiation\r\n7 (11/13)\r\nRS data collection\r\n8 (11/20)\r\nRS of vegetation\r\n9 (11/27)\r\nMultispectral RS analysis\r\n10 (12/4)\r\nActive RS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
