You make work with up to 2 classmates, but must list your collaborators’ names on your assignment. You are encouraged to collaborate on code, but must respond to conceptual questions individually. All assignment dates will be posted in advance. Late assignments will receive 10% deduction per day, up to a maximum of 3 days. You may request a 48-hour extension if extenuating circumstances arise.\r\nInformation on grading can be found here or outlined below.\r\nCore grading principles\r\nEach assignment will provide specific details of the point breakdowns per question. However, we will follow the general principles below for all assignments.\r\nCode must run\r\n50% deduction on each section that doesn’t run\r\n20% deduction from entire assignment for code that does not knit\r\nShow your answer and thought process\r\nLogical steps and checks are needed for full credit.\r\nMysterious or disorganized code without checks will not receive full credit.\r\nAnswer for yourself\r\nAlthough you are encouraged to collaborate with up to 2 classmates, you must provide your own answer to any non-code based questions.\r\nAll members of your group will lose full credit for non-code based questions that are copy/pasted among group members.\r\nSubmit assignments through GitHub Classrooms\r\nAll assignments should be submitted through GitHub Classrooms\r\n5% deduction for assignments not submitted through GitHub Classrooms\r\nAll students are granted one free pass\r\nAssignment rubric\r\nIn addition to the core principles outlined above, each assignment will be scored for its adherence to the following coding best practices. The maximum deduction for assignments which meet all the core principles but do not follow best practices (“worst case” below) will be 20 points for the assignment. Partial deductions will be given for assignments in between the “best case” and “worst case”.\r\nBest case [no deductions]\r\nCode is concise and easy to read\r\nNo stray variables (e.g. variables that are defined and never used)\r\nVariable names make sense\r\nGenerally follows the tidyverse style guide\r\n\r\nCode is commented thoroughly and clearly\r\nEvery section has an overall explanation\r\nEvery operation has an abbreviated explanation\r\nAny key steps or options are flagged in-line\r\n\r\nCode includes self-checks\r\nEach piece of analysis includes tests to inspect results\r\nIncludes comments to explain each test\r\nOutput is intuitive and well-explained\r\n\r\nOutputs are easy to understand\r\nPlots have appropriate axis and legend labels (e.g. don’t use variable names)\r\nMaps have scale bars and compasses\r\nTables are output using formatting utilities (e.g. kable)\r\nIncludes print statements clarifying output\r\nDoes not output irrelevant information or full datasets\r\n\r\nWorst case [maximum 20 point deduction]\r\nCode is challenging to understand\r\nLots of stray variables\r\nUnintuitive variable names\r\nDoes not adhere to tidyverse style guide\r\n\r\nCode is minimally or poorly commented\r\nOnly some steps are commented\r\nComments are uninformative (e.g. are redundant with code)\r\n\r\nCode includes few, if any, self-checks or are poorly formed\r\nChecks don’t perform desired test\r\nChecks don’t demonstrate critical thinking of the analysis at hand\r\nOutputs are difficult to interpret\r\n\r\nOutputs are difficult to understand\r\nPlots use automatic options (e.g. variable names as axis titles)\r\nTables are output by default\r\nOutputs without print statement explanations\r\nLots of extra outputs not relevant to the question\r\n\r\nAnswer keys\r\nAccess assignment 2 answer key Rmd\r\nAccess assignment 2 answer key html\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The emphasis is on deep understanding of spatial data models and the analytic operations they enable. Recognizing remotely sensed data as a key data type within environmental data science, this course will also introduce fundamental concepts and applications of remote sensing. In addition to this theoretical background, students will become familiar with libraries, packages, and APIs that support spatial analysis in R.\r\nWelcome!\r\nTeaching team\r\nInstructor: Ruth Oliver (rutholiver@bren.ucsb.edu)\r\nOffice: Bren Hall 4512\r\nStudent hours: Friday 1-2pm PT\r\nThe best way to contact me is: email\r\nTeaching assistant: Allie Caughman (acaughman@bren.ucsb.edu)\r\nStudent hours: Tuesday 12:30-1:30pm PT (Bren 3526)\r\nThe best way to contact me is: email\r\nImportant links\r\nCourse syllabus\r\nCode of Conduct\r\nAlert us to any absences here\r\nGeocomputation with R\r\nWeekly course schedule\r\nTuesday 9:30-12:15 PT (Bren Hall 1424)\r\nDiscussion section - Thursday 11:30-12:20 or 12:30-1:20 PT (Bren 3526)\r\nCourse requirements\r\nMinimum MEDS device requirements\r\nR version 4.2.0 (or higher)\r\nRStudio version 2022.07.01 (or higher)\r\nGitHub account\r\nTentative topics\r\nWeek\r\nTopics\r\n1 (10/2)\r\nCourse overview & intro to spatial data models\r\n2 (10/9)\r\nIntro to vector data\r\n3 (10/16)\r\nVector operations\r\n4 (10/23)\r\nIntro to raster data & operations\r\n5 (10/30)\r\nGuest speakers\r\n6 (11/6)\r\nIntro to RS & EM radiation\r\n7 (11/13)\r\nRS data collection\r\n8 (11/20)\r\nRS of vegetation\r\n9 (11/27)\r\nMultispectral RS analysis\r\n10 (12/4)\r\nActive RS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
