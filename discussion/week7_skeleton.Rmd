# read in shapefile of the counties of North Carolina

```

```{r}
# combines all geometries without resolving borders

```

```{r}
# finds the union of all geometries

```

```{r}
# let's exploring removing geometries
# pick a few counties to remove

```

```{r}
# plot counties on top of the unioned version of NC

```

```{r}
# create a new geometry that is the difference between the unioned version of NC and the counties

```

```{r}
# plot the difference on top of the unioned version of NC
# counties should be missing!

```
